This package serves as a portable deep learning toolbox for fusing physical and neural models. It's built upon [Flux.jl](https://github.com/FluxML/Flux.jl) and [DiffEqFlux.jl](https://github.com/SciML/DiffEqFlux.jl). The name of course comes from the 1972 film by Andrei Tarkovsky, which discusses the ultimate inadequacy of communication between human and non-human species.
