This package serves as a portable toolbox for fusing physical and machine learning models. It's built upon [Optimization](https://github.com/SciML/Optimization.jl) and compatible with both implicit [Flux](https://github.com/FluxML/Flux.jl) and explicit [Lux](https://github.com/LuxDL/Lux.jl) neural networks. The name of the package comes from the 1972 film by Andrei Tarkovsky, which discusses the ultimate inadequacy of communication between human and non-human species.
